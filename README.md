# libraryhours
This code was written to display today's open hours on the library's homepage. Being an academic library, there are different hours for the semester, breaks, exams, and holidays. Typical examples of hour displays that I found across the web assumed a set weekly schedule that never changed or one that was interupted only by the occassional holiday. This code is meant to address the several different hour schedules in hopes that you can set the hours and forget about them for a semester or maybe a little longer.
Explanations of some lines of code are in the associated files as comments.
